# 🧠 Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS)

**An AI-driven framework for measuring human understanding, confidence calibration, and cognitive stability.**

HCMS is a research-backed cognitive assessment system that goes beyond right-or-wrong answers.  
It models *how* a learner thinks, *how confident* they are, *how consistent* they remain, and *how well-calibrated* their understanding truly is.

This repository represents the **final consolidated product and research implementation (Phases 1–15)**.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

HCMS evaluates cognition across multiple dimensions:

- **Understanding Level** — Depth and correctness of conceptual grasp  
- **Confidence Calibration** — Alignment between confidence and accuracy  
- **Consistency** — Stability of reasoning across attempts  
- **Misconception Detection** — Rule-based cognitive error identification  
- **Adaptive Feedback** — Targeted remediation and reinforcement  
- **Robustness Analysis** — Resistance to noisy or adversarial inputs  
- **Explainability** — Transparent decision tracing and feature attribution

## 🚀 How to Run the System

### 1️⃣ Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Run the Full Cognitive Pipeline
bash
Copy code
python cognition_ai/run_full_system.py
3️⃣ Output
A finalized learner profile is generated at:

bash
Copy code
cognition_ai/outputs/final_learner_report.json
📊 Example Output (Simplified)
json
Copy code
{
  "Understanding Level": "Partial",
  "Calibration": "Miscalibrated",
  "Consistency Score": 0.83,
  "System Verdict": "Needs targeted remediation"
}
This output reflects how a learner thinks, not just whether they answered correctly.

## 🧪 Research Foundation

HCMS was developed through **15 structured research phases**, including:

- **Controlled experiments** – Testing core cognitive behaviors  
- **Validation & consistency checks** – Ensuring reliability across trials  
- **Confidence–accuracy correlation analysis** – Measuring self-awareness of understanding  
- **Stress testing** – Evaluating performance under noise & adversarial conditions  
- **Explainability & decision tracing** – Transparent analysis of reasoning  
- **Adaptive feedback systems** – Personalized remediation & reinforcement  
- **Full system integration** – Combining all components into a cohesive framework  

> *Each phase builds upon the previous, maintaining strict scientific continuity.*

## 🎯 Use Cases

HCMS is designed for **scalable, intelligent assessment** across educational and research settings:

- **Education Technology (EdTech)**  
- **Adaptive Learning Platforms**  
- **AI-based Assessment Systems**  
- **Cognitive Science Research**  
- **Personalized Skill Evaluation**  
- **Intelligent Tutoring Systems**  

> *Scales from individual learners to institution-level assessment systems.*

---

## 🧠 Why HCMS Is Different

Traditional assessments ask:  

> “Did the student get it right?”  

HCMS asks:  

> “Do they truly understand — and do they **know** that they understand?”  

This distinction enables:

- **Better learning outcomes**  
- **Early misconception detection**  
- **Personalized intervention**  
- **Fairer and deeper evaluation**

## 📌 Project Status

- ✅ Research complete  
- ✅ System consolidated  
- ✅ Final product operational  
- ✅ Paper drafted  
- ✅ Ready for publication, demonstration, or extension

**An AI-driven framework for measuring human understanding, confidence calibration, and cognitive stability.**

The **Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS)** is a research-grade cognitive assessment framework designed to move beyond right-or-wrong evaluation. Rather than treating intelligence as a static score, HCMS models **how a learner thinks**, **how confident they are**, **how consistent their reasoning remains**, and **how well-calibrated their understanding truly is**.

This repository represents the **final consolidated research system and product implementation**, spanning **Phases 1–15** of structured development.

---

## ✨ Core Capabilities

HCMS evaluates cognition across multiple, interdependent dimensions:

* **Understanding Level** — Depth, structure, and correctness of conceptual grasp
* **Confidence Calibration** — Alignment between self-reported confidence and actual performance
* **Consistency** — Stability of reasoning across attempts and conditions
* **Misconception Detection** — Rule-based and statistical identification of cognitive errors
* **Adaptive Feedback** — Targeted remediation and reinforcement strategies
* **Robustness Analysis** — Resistance to noisy, incomplete, or adversarial inputs
* **Explainability** — Transparent decision tracing and feature-level attribution
