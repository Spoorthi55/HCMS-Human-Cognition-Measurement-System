# HCMS v1.1 — Cognitive Stability Under Controlled Perturbation

## Purpose

HCMS v1.1 introduces a controlled perturbation protocol to evaluate whether inferred cognitive states remain stable when surface-level task features vary while semantic meaning is preserved.

This extension directly tests the central research question:
**Are static accuracy-based assessments sufficient indicators of stable understanding?**

---

## Hypothesis

Learners exhibiting confidence–accuracy misalignment will demonstrate significantly greater cognitive instability under perturbation than aligned learners, even when baseline accuracy is comparable.

---

## Cognitive Group Definitions

Participants are categorized using existing HCMS outputs, independent of raw accuracy:

### 1. Aligned Cognition
- High confidence–accuracy alignment
- Low calibration error
- High reasoning consistency

### 2. Overconfident Misalignment
- High confidence
- Lower or moderate accuracy
- High calibration error

### 3. Underconfident Misalignment
- High accuracy
- Low confidence
- Moderate calibration error

## Perturbation Design

A minimal, controlled perturbation is applied to previously encountered assessment items:

- Surface-level rephrasing
- Minor contextual noise
- Semantic-preserving variation

Perturbations are designed to:
- Preserve conceptual difficulty
- Avoid introducing new knowledge
- Isolate stability of understanding

---

## Stability Metrics

The following cognition-aware metrics are evaluated before and after perturbation:

- Reasoning consistency
- Confidence variance
- Cognitive state transition rate
- Stability degradation index

---

## Evaluation Method

Stability degradation is computed as the delta between baseline and perturbed cognitive metrics.

Comparisons across cognitive groups evaluate:
- Sensitivity of cognition-aware indicators
- Failure modes of accuracy-only assessment

---

## Expected Outcome

It is expected that:
- Aligned cognition remains stable under perturbation
- Misaligned cognition degrades significantly
- Static accuracy fails to predict robustness

---

## Scientific Contribution

This extension demonstrates that **cognitive alignment**, rather than raw correctness, is a stronger indicator of robust understanding, reinforcing the need for cognition-aware assessment systems.
