# Conclusion

This work presented the Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS), a comprehensive framework for measuring understanding beyond correctness. By integrating accuracy, confidence, consistency, and explainability, HCMS provides a deeper and more truthful representation of learner cognition.

The results demonstrate that cognition-aware assessment can reveal hidden weaknesses, overconfidence, and unstable reasoning that traditional systems overlook. HCMS is modular, interpretable, and robust, making it suitable for both research and real-world deployment.

Future work will focus on large-scale user studies, integration with learning platforms, and the incorporation of temporal learning trajectories. Ultimately, HCMS represents a step toward assessment systems that measure **how people think**, not just **what they answer**.
