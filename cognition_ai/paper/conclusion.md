# Conclusion

This work introduced the Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS), a cognition-aware assessment framework designed to move beyond correctness-based evaluation toward more faithful measurement of understanding. By integrating accuracy, confidence calibration, and consistency, HCMS provides a structured and interpretable representation of learner cognition.

The results demonstrate that learners with similar accuracy profiles can exhibit substantially different cognitive stability and metacognitive alignment. These differences remain hidden in traditional assessment systems but are consistently revealed through cognition-aware metrics, particularly under controlled perturbation.

HCMS contributes a practical methodology for operationalizing cognitive constructs that have long been emphasized in learning science but underutilized in computational assessment. The framework is modular, reproducible, and designed to function both as a research instrument and as a foundation for adaptive learning systems.

By reframing assessment as the measurement of how learners think rather than what they answer, this work supports the development of more accurate, transparent, and human-aligned evaluation systems. HCMS represents an initial step toward assessment technologies that reflect the true structure and stability of human understanding.
