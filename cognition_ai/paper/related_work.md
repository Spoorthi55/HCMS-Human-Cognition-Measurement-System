Assessment systems have traditionally emphasized correctness-based evaluation, an approach rooted in standardized testing and automated grading. While effective for scalable performance measurement, such methods reduce understanding to a single observable outcome and overlook deeper cognitive properties.

### Metacognition and Confidence Calibration

Educational psychology research has long established the importance of metacognition, particularly learners’ ability to monitor and regulate their own understanding. Studies on confidence calibration demonstrate that systematic overconfidence and underconfidence are common and directly impact learning outcomes. However, these findings are typically examined in controlled psychological studies and are rarely operationalized in computational assessment systems.

### Learner Modeling and Intelligent Tutoring Systems

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and learner modeling approaches, including Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Item Response Theory, estimate latent mastery states based on observed performance. While effective for modeling knowledge acquisition, these methods generally treat confidence, stability, and metacognitive behavior as implicit or secondary signals.

### Learning Analytics and Behavioral Features

Recent work in learning analytics has explored behavioral indicators such as response time, attempt frequency, and revision patterns. Although these approaches provide richer signals than correctness alone, many rely on complex or opaque models that limit interpretability and robustness under real-world noise.

### Positioning of HCMS

HCMS differs from prior work by explicitly modeling cognition as a multi-signal measurement problem. Rather than optimizing prediction accuracy, HCMS focuses on interpretability, stability, and metacognitive alignment. Confidence, consistency, and robustness are treated as first-class cognitive signals rather than auxiliary features.

By integrating these dimensions into a unified, transparent framework, HCMS complements existing assessment and tutoring systems while addressing cognitive properties that are underrepresented in current computational approaches.
