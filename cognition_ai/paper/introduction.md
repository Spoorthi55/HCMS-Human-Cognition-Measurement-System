# Introduction

Accurate answers do not necessarily imply understanding. A learner may respond correctly through guessing, memorization, or unstable reasoning while lacking conceptual mastery. Despite this, most existing assessment systems equate correctness with comprehension, overlooking deeper cognitive signals such as confidence alignment, response consistency, and misconception persistence.

Human cognition is inherently multi-dimensional. Psychological and educational research has long emphasized the importance of metacognition — particularly a learner’s awareness of their own understanding. However, modern digital assessment platforms rarely operationalize these insights into measurable, system-level intelligence.

This paper introduces the **Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS)**, a comprehensive framework designed to move beyond correctness and toward **cognitive state estimation**. HCMS analyzes learner behavior across multiple dimensions: accuracy, confidence calibration, temporal stability, and reasoning consistency. By combining these signals, the system constructs an interpretable cognitive profile that reflects how well a learner understands a concept — not just whether they answered correctly.

HCMS is implemented as a multi-phase pipeline, progressing from raw response data to validated cognitive inference, robustness testing, explainability, and adaptive feedback generation. The system is designed to be transparent, modular, and research-oriented, making it suitable both as a production system and as an experimental platform.

The key contributions of this work are:
- A formalized, multi-dimensional cognition measurement framework
- Quantitative metrics for confidence calibration and consistency
- Robustness testing under noisy and adversarial conditions
- Explainable cognitive inference and adaptive intervention strategies

By rethinking assessment as cognitive measurement rather than answer checking, HCMS aims to bridge the gap between learning science and intelligent systems.
