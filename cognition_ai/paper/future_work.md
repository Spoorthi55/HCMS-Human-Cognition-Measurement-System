## Future Work

This work represents an initial investigation into cognition-aware assessment under controlled conditions. Future research will extend the Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS) along several directions.

First, longitudinal studies will be conducted to examine how cognitive stability and confidence calibration evolve over extended learning trajectories. This will enable evaluation of whether early confidence–accuracy misalignment predicts long-term learning outcomes and conceptual retention.

Second, cross-domain experiments will assess whether cognition signals inferred by HCMS generalize across different subject areas, task formats, and conceptual structures.

Third, synthetic learner simulations will be incorporated to enable controlled analysis of specific cognitive behaviors under known and repeatable conditions, strengthening causal interpretation.

Finally, future versions of HCMS will explore real-world deployment scenarios within educational platforms, enabling validation at scale while preserving interpretability and cognitive fidelity.

These extensions will strengthen the empirical grounding of cognition-aware assessment and further clarify the relationship between correctness, stability, and human understanding.
