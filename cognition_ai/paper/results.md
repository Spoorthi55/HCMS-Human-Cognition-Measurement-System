# Results

HCMS consistently identified cognitive patterns that accuracy-only systems failed to detect. Key findings include:

- Learners with high accuracy but low consistency were flagged as having partial understanding.
- Confidence–accuracy correlation values below 0.3 reliably indicated miscalibration.
- Robustness tests showed stable cognitive inference under moderate noise.
- Explainability modules provided clear reasoning paths for system decisions.

The final learner profiles combined understanding level, calibration status, and consistency into a concise, interpretable report.
