# Results

The results demonstrate a clear divergence between correctness-based evaluation and cognition-aware assessment. While raw accuracy remained similar across multiple learners, HCMS revealed substantial differences in cognitive stability, confidence calibration, and robustness under perturbation.

## Accuracy vs Cognitive Stability

Learners with comparable accuracy scores exhibited markedly different consistency and calibration profiles. In several cases, learners achieving high correctness displayed low stability across repeated trials, indicating fragile or surface-level understanding.

Conversely, some learners with moderate accuracy but high confidence–accuracy alignment maintained stable cognitive states across trials.

These findings indicate that accuracy alone is insufficient to characterize the quality or robustness of understanding.

## Confidence–Accuracy Alignment

Confidence–accuracy correlation emerged as a strong differentiating signal. Learners with alignment values below 0.3 consistently exhibited greater variance in confidence and consistency across trials.

Miscalibrated learners demonstrated unstable confidence behavior even when correctness was preserved, suggesting a disconnect between perceived and actual understanding.

Calibrated learners maintained consistent confidence responses aligned with performance, indicating stronger metacognitive awareness.

## Stability Under Controlled Perturbation

Under controlled perturbations, accuracy scores remained largely unchanged across learner groups. However, cognition-aware metrics showed significant divergence.

Miscalibrated learners experienced pronounced degradation in consistency scores and increased variance in inferred cognitive state following perturbation. In contrast, calibrated learners demonstrated minimal stability loss under identical conditions.

This divergence highlights that perturbation reveals weaknesses in understanding not captured by static correctness measures.

## Cognitive Profile Differentiation

HCMS-generated cognitive profiles integrated accuracy, calibration, and stability into a unified learner representation.

In multiple cases, learners classified as equivalent by accuracy-only evaluation were assigned different cognitive verdicts by HCMS, including distinctions between stable mastery, partial understanding, and unstable reasoning.

These distinctions remained consistent across repeated experimental runs.

## Summary of Findings

Overall, the results show that:
- Accuracy does not reliably indicate cognitive stability
- Confidence–accuracy misalignment predicts robustness degradation
- Cognition-aware metrics reveal latent differences masked by static scores

These findings support the use of multi-dimensional cognitive assessment for more faithful measurement of understanding.
