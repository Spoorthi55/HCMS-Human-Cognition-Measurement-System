## Key Observations

1. Accuracy alone fails to explain cognitive state.
2. Confidence calibration error varies independently of mastery.
3. Concepts show different mastery trajectories under equal exposure.

## Interpretation

The results suggest that confidence-aware adaptive assessment captures latent cognitive signals beyond correctness.

## Limitations

- Small sample size (single participant)
- Lexical misconception detection only

## Implications

HCMS demonstrates feasibility as a cognition measurement instrument rather than a tutoring system.
