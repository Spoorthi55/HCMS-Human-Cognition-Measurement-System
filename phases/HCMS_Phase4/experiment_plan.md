Experiment Title

Measuring Conceptual Understanding Using Confidence-Calibrated Adaptive Assessment

Research Question

Can a confidence-aware adaptive assessment system detect misconceptions and learning states beyond binary correctness?

Hypotheses

H1: Users with the same accuracy can have different mastery trajectories
H2: Confidence miscalibration predicts misconception persistence
H3: Explanation text contains detectable misconception signals

Independent Variables

Question difficulty

Concept type

User confidence

Dependent Variables
