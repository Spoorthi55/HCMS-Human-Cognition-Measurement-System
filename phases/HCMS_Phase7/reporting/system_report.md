# Human Cognition Measurement System (HCMS)

## Overview
HCMS is a research-grade system designed to measure understanding rather than correctness.

## What It Measures
- Conceptual mastery
- Confidence calibration
- Cognitive consistency
- Misconception patterns

## Key Findings
- Confidence–accuracy correlation is not guaranteed
- Overconfidence is detectable
- Understanding is multi-dimensional

## Why This Matters
Traditional exams fail to measure thinking. HCMS measures cognition.
